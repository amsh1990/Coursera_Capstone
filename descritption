Market Research & Data Analysis of Food Venues in Toronto

INTRODUCTION 
Toronto is a big city and has many neighborhoods that have a sufficient number of shops and food venues.
Business owners would like to know which kinds of food venues (type of cuisine) lack in which neghborhoods in the city 
as this might give them an insight on what type of restaurant do particular neighborhoods need. Therefore, the objective of this 
project is to create a recommendation list which inlists the types of food venues needed in which neghborhoods. 


DATA
The list will be created after exploring each neighborhood and sorting the restaurants by type. Then, the restaurants will be grouped 
and counted to see if there is a sufficient number of that restaurnt type in a particular neighborhood.
